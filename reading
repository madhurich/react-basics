>In order to set up react project, we need "webpack"
Web pack is a tool that is used to bundle all the js files
that are used in our project folder.
We write the code in es2015 (called as es6), this must
be converted to es5 as most browsers doesn't support es6.
So webpack deals all with these. We install modules into this webpack
that are responsible for transpilation(convertion) of es6 to es5.

babel is the plugin that is put into this webpack which is responsible for
transpilation of code.

COMMANDS TO SETUP
1. npm init
2.npm install react react-dom --save
  						>if we don't use "--save-dev" in a command
  						and use only "--save" those will be saved in dependencies
  						array in package.json and they are "production(run)" dependencies
3. npm install webpack webpack-dev-server babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react --save-dev
						>and these are used in "development(build)" to develop the app  

use   "scripts": {
    "start": "npm run build",
    "build": "webpack -d & copy \"src/index.html\" \"dist/index.html\" /Y & webpack-dev-server --content-base src/ --inline --hot",
    "build:prod": "webpack -p & copy \"src/index.html\" \"dist/index.html\" /Y"
  },ï»¿
 instead of code given in the video. This worked.
 also replace "hot" with watch if you don't want to see WDS hot module etc etc in the console.
